<!-- This is how you add comments to HTML -->

<!-- You can also include

<!-- HTML files have two fundamental parts. (1) The head, (2) The body -->

<!-- The head contains things that you do not see on the page -->

<head>

</head>

<!-- The body contains thigs you see -->
<!-- Most elements both open and close, with the content in the middle -->
<!-- Indenting is optional, but helps with readability -->
